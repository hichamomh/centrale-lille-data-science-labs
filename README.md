# Centrale Lille â€“ Data Science & Machine Learning Labs

This repository gathers a collection of **hands-on projects** and **academic labs** completed during my engineering studies at **Centrale Lille**.  
Each folder illustrates a specific aspect of **data science, machine learning, or applied mathematics**, implemented in Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
