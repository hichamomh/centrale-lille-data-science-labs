## Requirements

Install

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Python Virtual environment with conda

> A [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) is a self-contained directory tree that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus a number of additional packages.

It is always good practice to work in a virtual environment, isolated from your other Python projects.

In this course, we will use [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html), both as

- an [environment manager](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#)
- a [package manager](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-pkgs.html).

See also the [conda cheat sheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/cheatsheet.html).

### Exercise 1

- Read the [Getting Started section of the conda documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html)

In your terminal

- list the `conda` environments currently available on your machine

- For the `base` environment
  - list the installed packages
  - what were the channels used to install the different packages?

- Create a conda environment called `myenv` with Python 3.8.2
  - install `numpy`
  - install `matplotlib` using `pip`
  - list the installed packages
  - export the environment to a cross-platform `myenv.yml` file
  - delete the environment `myenv`

- Recreate the conda environment `myenv` from the previous `myenv.yml` file
  - update the Python version to its latest version.
  - install `scipy` using the `conda-forge` channel
  - export the environment to a cross-platform `myenv2.yml` file

## Integrated Development Environment - VSCode

[Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended to ease your coding experience.

**Important:** Use the [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks#_command-palette) ( `CMD/CRTL + Maj + P` ).

See also

- [VSCode setup documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)
- [guilgautier/vscode-workflow](https://github.com/guilgautier/vscode-workflow) repository

**Tip:** You may also consider [synchronizing your settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync), in order to keep the same setup each time you use VSCode (even from a different machine).

### Launch VSCode

#### From Anaconda Navigator

Launch [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/index.html#:~:text=Anaconda%20Navigator%20is%20a%20desktop,in%20a%20local%20Anaconda%20Repository.)

- (Windows) Open [Start Menu](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/open-the-start-menu-4ed57ad7-ed1f-3cc9-c9e4-f329822f5aeb) (Windows key)
- (MacOS) Open [Spotlight](https://support.apple.com/fr-fr/guide/mac-help/mchlp1008/mac) (CMD + Space)

- Search for and open `Anaconda-Navigator`

- Click on VSCode->Launch

#### From the command line

```bash
# cd path-to-your-projet
code . # open VSCode and define a workspace from current directory
code README.md  # open README.md in VSCode
```

- [code is not recognized as an internal or external command](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/command-line#_code-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command)

### Per project configuration

The [.vscode](../../../.vscode) directory, placed at the root of your project workspace, contains a list of suggested extensions together with the corresponding settings, code snippets, etc.
You can share the [.vscode](../../../.vscode) directory with your collaborator, e.g., using git/GitHub, to make sure you have some common setup.

Note: This configuration only applies in the current workspace and has precedence over global user settings, see also [Settings](#settings) and [Snippets](#snippets).

### Extensions

All registered extensions are available on [VSCode's Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode).
Extensions can also be installed locally from your VSCode window, see the [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace).

The [.vscode/extensions.json](../../../.vscode/extensions.json) file contains a list of suggested extensions that will *greatly* simplify your coding workflow.

### Launch a Jupyter notebook

- Within VSCode, the [Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) provides a full [Jupyter notebook experience within VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
  - Simply open a `.ipynb` file located in [`notebooks/`](./notebooks/)

- From the command line

  ```bash
  # cd sdia-python/notebooks
  # activate sdia-python
  jupyter notebook
  ```

#### Exercise 2

- Install the extensions listed in [.vscode/extensions.json](../../../.vscode/extensions.json)
- Launch Lab1 notebook inside Vscode

### Settings

> [VSCode settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings) You can configure Visual Studio Code to your liking through its various settings. Nearly every part of VSCode's editor, user interface, and functional behavior has options you can modify.

To do so, you can either define settings

- Globally: Open the Command Palette ( `CMD/CRTL + Maj + P` ) and type either
  - `Open User Settings`, or
  - `Open Settings (JSON)`,
- Per project: see [settings.json](../../../.vscode/settings.json).

See also [guilgautier/vscode-workflow](https://github.com/guilgautier/vscode-workflow) repository.

#### Exercise 3

- Change the location of the VSCode sidebar left <-> right.

### Snippets

> [Code snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets) are templates that make it easier to enter repeating code patterns, such as loops or conditional-statements.

Many language-specific [extensions](#extensions) already provide some useful snippets.
While some of them exactly match your needs, some others might be missing or you may not remember how to trigger them.

For these reasons you may create your own snippets to increase your productivity.
To do so, you can either define snippets

- Globally: Open the Command Palette ( `CMD/CRTL + Maj + P` ) and type `Configure User Snippets` and choose to create
  - language-specific snippets,
  - generic snippets that can be triggered in different scopes.
- Per project: see [workspace.code-snippets](../../../.vscode/workspace.code-snippets)

See also [guilgautier/vscode-workflow](https://github.com/guilgautier/vscode-workflow) repository.

#### Exercise 4

- Create your own `mygithub` snippet and make it available only in Markdown (`.md`) files.
- Create an `forenum` Python snippet, that displays when triggered in Python (`.py`) files

  ```python
  for idx, val in enumerate(values):
      print(idx, val)
  ```

### Version control within VSCode

All, and more, of what we experimented with `git` from the command line (cf. [`notes/command_line.md`](./command_line.md)) can be achieved within VSCode, using

- the [VSCode integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal)
- the [VSCode version control tool](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol)
